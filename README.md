# NoSQL-Challenge-Social-Network-API

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The project aimed to explore and understand how to use databases without relying on SQL. By building this project, I gained hands-on experience in working with alternative database technologies and gained a deeper understanding of their features, limitations, and benefits compared to traditional SQL-based databases.

The problem it solves is the limitation of relying solely on SQL for working with databases. SQL is a powerful language for querying and manipulating data, but there are other database systems that offer different approaches and functionalities. By exploring non-SQL databases, I aimed to broaden my understanding of different database paradigms and their applicability in various scenarios.

Throughout the project, I learned about different types of non-SQL databases, such as NoSQL databases (e.g., document databases, key-value stores, graph databases), NewSQL databases, and other emerging database technologies. I learned how to work with these databases, model data, perform CRUD operations, and leverage their unique features.

Additionally, I gained insights into the trade-offs between SQL and non-SQL databases, such as scalability, performance, flexibility, and ease of use. This knowledge allows me to make informed decisions when choosing the appropriate database technology for specific use cases, considering factors such as data structure, access patterns, and scalability requirements.
